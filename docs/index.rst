Welcome
=======

Edge Data Store is a highly flexible sequential data historian that is
used to store, retrieve, and analyze data. You create and write data
to streams using a simple REST API. The streams are able to store simple or
complex data types to suit the application needs. An assortment of
methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and
easily obtain needed information.

The internal libraries used in Edge Data Store are code named "Qi". 
These libraries are the basis of Edge DS as well as OSIsoft Cloud Services Storage. Therefore, 
if you are familiar with OSIsoft Cloud Services, many of the programming concepts will be exactly the same
using Edge Data Store.
